                Many launchers have been released for PC, at least brand-exclusive for company games, but none have been able to match 
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>
                 Most of the launchers only provide self-published games. Steam has been every PC player's go-to game buying and management platform 
                 for years. None of the launchers came close, at least not until the release of <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/">Epic Games</a> own launcher. 
                 Both have the same service of providing games to the players, but the adopted methodology to do so is like chalk and cheese.

                Comparing both, if you love customization, community interactions, and meeting new people, then Steam is your go-to gaming platform 
                on PC. If you like minimalistic design, as far as the UI is concerned, then the Epic Games launcher is your best bet. 
                If you are only looking for quality content, Epic Games Store can help you out there.
                And if you are a developer, I'd say Epic Games Store is one of the best both in terms of support and revenue split.<br> <br>
                Overall, Steam still takes the victory home, based purely on the range and variety it offers in terms of features and customization
                 options. It has better community interaction and mod support tools thanks to Steam Workshop.Epic Games Launcher still have a 
                 few things they can tweak for a better overall experience. It is not to take away from the launcher, but it just doesn't offer nearly 
                 as much as Steam when it comes to other activities (streaming support, community place, marketplace, customization, etc.).
