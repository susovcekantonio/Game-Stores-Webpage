            When we talk about the number of games and the variety, Steam, without a doubt, knocks Epic Games Store out of the park. Steam offers all sorts of 
            games, whether bad or good. To put it simply, there is no filter, and any and all types of games can be found on Steam.
            The good thing about Steam is that it allows you to filter your genres to come up with a suitable type of game.

        <p class="steam_left_p">
            <span class="p_text">OTHER OPTIONS<br></span>
            Steam has a Discovery Queue feature that helps players find new games by showcasing the new releases, top-selling titles, and games
             similar to those you play or own on Steam. It also features an Explore Queue, which showcases recommended games based on your search 
             history and other users' search history.

            <span class="p_text">PRICING<br></span>
            When it comes to pricing, Steam showcases the price in favor of the dollar conversion rate. This is because Steam offers more local 
            currencies than Epic Games Store. Due to the market constantly changing, there is a chance that prices on Steam may fluctuate for some 
            users from specific regions.
